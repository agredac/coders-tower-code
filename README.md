Stronger bases to grow higher

I am Daniel Andres Pelaez Lopez. I am a Software Engineer with more than 10 of experience developing software.

Doing software is easy, doing it well and in a professional way, is not.

I created this blog to share my experiences and thoughts about being a professional Software Engineer, I believe that with stronger concepts and bases, we can grow higher in our careers.
